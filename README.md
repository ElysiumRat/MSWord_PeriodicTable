# MSWord_WhatElement

VBA macros for word that allow for input of a chemical symbol, with an output telling you what the full name is (WhatElement), or vice versa (WhatChemSymbol).

The search functionality works by first checking against selected text, or, if it can't find anything, by allowing the user to input the element symbol (WhatElement) or name (WhatChemSymbol) before checking.
